Overview
A jaded bartender is wooed by a charmingly quirky couple in this fresh and sizzling polyamorous rom-com, set in the glamorous world of high-end cocktail bars‚Äîfrom the acclaimed author of the ‚Äútender, decadent, and sparklingly funny‚Äù (Lana Harper, New York Times bestselling author) Chef‚Äôs Choice.
 
 As a bartender at Terror &amp; Virtue, a swanky New York City cocktail lounge known for its romantic atmosphere and Insta-worthy drinks, Mel has witnessed plenty of disastrous dates. That, coupled with her own romantic life being in shambles, has Mel convinced love doesn‚Äôt exist.
 
 Everything changes when Bebe walks into the bar. She‚Äôs beautiful, funny, knows her whiskeys‚Äîand is happily married to her partner, Kade. Mel‚Äôs resigned to forget the whole thing, but Bebe makes her a unique offer: since she and Kade have an open marriage, she‚Äôs interested in taking Mel on a date.
 
 What starts as a fun romp turns into a burgeoning relationship, and soon Mel is trying all sorts of things she‚Äôd been avoiding, from grand romantic gestures to steamy exploits. Mel even gets the self-confidence to enter a cocktail competition that would make her dream of opening her own bar a reality. In the chaotic whirl of all these new experiences, Mel realizes there might be a spark between her and Kade, too. As Bebe, Kade, and Mel explore their connections, Mel begins to think that real love might be more expansive than she ever thought possible.
 
 With TJ Alexander‚Äôs signature ‚Äúwitty and insightful voice, complex characters, and full-throated celebration of the joy of queer community‚Äù (Ava Wilder, author of How to Fake It in Hollywood), Triple Sec is a passionate, thirst-quenching love story that will have you asking for another round...or three.
