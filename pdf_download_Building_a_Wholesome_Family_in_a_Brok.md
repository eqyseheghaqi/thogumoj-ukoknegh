Overview
How do the Habsburgs approach family life? In a world that has gone mad, building a wholesome family cradle is daunting and often seems impossible. At the same time, many dare to dream of happiness in family life even today. How can you find the right spouse — and make a lifelong marriage work — in a culture that values transaction over commitment? How do you decide on core values and pass them on to your children? What are some practical ways to raise a family in the Faith? Let Archduke Eduard Habsburg guide you on the ultimate adventure of building a family. As a father of six and now a grandfather, the Archduke of Austria shares his own experiences and recipes for a wholesome family life, bolstered by 850 years of Habsburg family history.  With his humorous and relatable style, Eduard dives deep into his family’s storied past to give you true principles to live by and a Great Plan for lifelong joy. You will journey with the Habsburgs step-by-step through the centuries — from falling in love to engagement, marriage, pregnancy, birth and Baptism, and everyday life, to seeing your children grow up and start families of their own.  With candor and affability, Eduard provides practical and spiritual tips on dating, engagement, and cultivating a happy marriage. Through fascinating real-life stories and examples, he explores: Five items on the “Spouse Bucket List” to help you experience a strong and fulfilling relationship Practical advice for new parents, and the benefits of having a large family Lessons from Blessed Charles and Empress Zita on why prayer is foundational in marriage Ways to strengthen family life through traditions How to care for each other — even in sickness and at the end of life As you discover inspiring paragons of loving marriages in the Habsburg family history, you will find concrete ways to nurture and educate your children to be truly happy in a world in which wholesome family life has become countercultural. As this scion of one of the great Catholic families in Western history reminds us, “This is the way!”
