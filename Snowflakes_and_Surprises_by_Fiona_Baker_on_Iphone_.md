Overview
A sweet, uplifting small-town holiday romance that celebrates the bonds between family and the magic of the season. Settle in by the light of the Christmas tree and get swept away to this charming mountain town!

 All her life, Caroline Stoker has been the sensible one. She dresses sensibly, acts sensibly, and she&#039;s certainly never believed in fairy tales. Unlike her two younger sisters, who left Evergreen Hollow to spread their wings and explore new places, Caroline has spent her entire life in the small mountain town. She&#039;s happy with her life and content with her choices... or so she thinks, until one holiday season, her world gets shaken up like a snow globe. It starts with a small accidental fire at the Mistletoe Inn, and her introduction to the town&#039;s newest resident: Rhett Dawkins. He&#039;s a single father who came to Evergreen Hollow in search of a slower pace for him and his son. She and Rhett have nothing in common-or at least, that&#039;s what she tells herself. But when the handsome firefighter sweeps her off her feet like a real life Prince Charming, Caroline starts to wonder if maybe she was wrong. Maybe fairy tales do exist, if you&#039;re brave enough to let yourself believe in them. Meanwhile, Nora and Aiden are excited to celebrate their first Christmas as a newly married couple, and Nora is busy decorating their house for a huge holiday party. But when a key centerpiece of her decorations is back-ordered, she&#039;s forced to improvise.
