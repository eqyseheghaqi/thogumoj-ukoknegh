This remarkable novel, a Printz Honor winner and William C. Morris Award finalist, follows a teen during her life-changing move to Ireland. A searing exploration of grief, first love, and the transformative power of music, the bookâ€”now with a new letter from the authorâ€”is perfect for fans of Emergency Contact, We Are Okay, and Iâ€™ll Give You the Sun. Sixteen-year-old Maggie Lynchâ€™s heart pulses to the beat of Pearl Jam and the Smashing Pumpkins, but when her mother uproots them from Chicago to a tiny town in Ireland, Maggie struggles to adjust. Her uncle Kevin, who happens to be a grunge musician, is her only connection to home. Though he keeps Maggie supplied with the latest issues of Spin, she still feels totally isolated. When a visit from Kevin goes wrong and tragedy strikes, Maggie knows that she canâ€™t let the world pass her by a moment longer. To fulfill a dying wish, she breaks her motherâ€™s rules by traveling to Rome for a concert. The journey is harder than she ever guessed, but maybe, along the way, Maggie will learn to live her life to the fullest.
