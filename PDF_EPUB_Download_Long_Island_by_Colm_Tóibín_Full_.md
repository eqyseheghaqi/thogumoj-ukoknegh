Notes From Your Bookseller We were so, so pleased when we heard that Colm TÃ³ib&amp;amp;iacuten was writing a sequel to his beloved novel, Brooklyn. Family secrets and complicated choices drive this exhilarating story that we won&amp;#039;t forget. From the beloved, critically acclaimed New York Times bestselling author comes a spectacularly moving and intense novel of secrecy, misunderstanding, and love, the story of Eilis Lacey, the complex and enigmatic heroine of Brooklyn, TÃ³ibÃ­nâ€™s most popular work twenty years later.
 
 Eilis Lacey is Irish, married to Tony Fiorello, a plumber and one of four Italian American brothers, all of whom live in neighboring houses on a cul-de-sac in Lindenhurst, Long Island, with their wives and children and Tonyâ€™s parents, a huge extended family that lives and works, eats and plays together. It is the spring of 1976 and Eilis, now in her forties with two teenage children, has no one to rely on in this still-new country. Though her ties to Ireland remain stronger than those that hold her to her new land and home, she has not returned in decades.
 
 One day, when Tony is at his job and Eilis is in her home office doing her accounting, an Irishman comes to the door asking for her by name. He tells her that his wife is pregnant with Tonyâ€™s child and that when the baby is born, he will not raise it but instead deposit it on Eilisâ€™s doorstep. It is what Eilis doesâ€”and what she refuses to doâ€”in response to this stunning news that makes TÃ³ibÃ­nâ€™s novel so riveting.
 
 Long Island is about longings unfulfilled, even unrecognized. The silences in Eilisâ€™ life are thunderous and dangerous, and thereâ€™s no one more deft than TÃ³ibÃ­n at giving them language. This is a gorgeous story of a woman alone in a marriage and the deepest bonds she rekindles on her return to the place and people she left behind, to ways of living and loving she thought sheâ€™d lost.
